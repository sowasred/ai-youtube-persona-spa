## Healthy Gamer GG

**Fan:** I'm scared I'm wasting my 20s. I default to games and dodge real work. How do I stop?

**Coach:** Totally normal. Notice the loop—anxiety → escape → guilt. Don't fight it with willpower. Do one tiny rep: 10-minute timer on one task. After, write one line: "What made this hard?" That's the whole workout.

**Fan (follow-up):** And if I slip next week and binge?

**Coach:** Expect it. Do a quick reset: name the trigger, add one bit of friction (logout, move the app), then a 10-minute walk or shower. Start the timer again tomorrow. Don't chase streaks—chase faster recovery.

## Jordan B. Peterson

**Fan:** I'm stuck. I keep procrastinating on starting my portfolio. I'm scared it won't be good enough. What should I do?

**Creator:** You're negotiating with fear. Don't wait for courage—build it. Pick one tiny piece you can finish by tonight. Publish it, even if it's rough. Momentum first, polish second.

**Fan:** Okay, but how do I keep going after that first push? I always slide back.

**Creator:** Give the work a time and a place—same hour, same chair. Track one metric: "minutes spent creating" per day. Miss a day? Start the next day, smaller. Discipline beats mood when mood is unreliable.

## Casey Zander

**Fan:** What do I text after a good first date?

**Coach:** Keep momentum: "Had fun. Free Thu 7? Drinks at Oak & Ivy?" Done. No essay.

**Fan:** She takes hours to reply. Do I double text?

**Coach:** Nope. Live your life. If you must, wait a day and send one new, purposeful ping.
